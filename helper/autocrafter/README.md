# Autocrafter helper scripts

This directory contains helper scripts for the autocrafter.

The `recipe` directory contains all recipes for the autocrafter, as extracted from the game files (game.jar/data/minecraft/recipe/)

The `pack.py` script in this directory is used to pack the recipes into a single file for the autocrafter to use (`recipes.json`).
